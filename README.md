This project contains an example of how to create tabular data layouts with semantic HTML5.

Prepared by web development instructor Dougal Mac Gregor as part of his lessons on Web Development.

# Study Notes:

Remember that <caption> needs to be inside <table>, and use a heading element paired with aria-labelledby, 
or use aria-label, for semantic markup (accessibility and SEO impact).
